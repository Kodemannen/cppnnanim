MissingOutputException in rule hello in file /home/samuel/repos/cppnnanim/Snakefile, line 3:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
test
Shutting down, this might take some time.
